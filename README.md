## Welcome to Simeron's Arcade! 🕹👾🎲🎮🃏

### Random Quote Generator 🔮🃏🎴✨

### Simerons arcade is a series of litte mini applications. Design to help me learn and put all my learnings in one place. The arcade will bit filled with a varity of different types of apps (sorry they aren't all games! 😅) there will some games, calculators, and other everyday essential items that have been transformed with HTML / CSS / JS. I want to use this as a chance to me to upskill in a bitsized fashion and to use my love of design along the way. The design may now always be conventional... But hopefully it will always be with beautiful or fun!

### Enjoy!

**Where I was inspired:** I have been working through the freecode camp courses for web development. So far I have done the JS section, framesworks, jquery, react and redux. I got to the point where it suggests small apps and projects that you can build and this was the first one. A random quote generator! Ther was a bit of very breif spec to follow but overall you could do whatever you wanted with it. I coded everything myself from scratch on this project, with one bit of help from my mentor. Here is how mine is different:

**The theme and showcasing my design skills** All the example I saw online were all based around the same the kind of design. I wanted mine to stand out and have a theme, I thought it would be fun to go with a fortune teller theme. As this would also give me a chance to learn some new CSS skills and showcase my eye for design. 

**Accessibility:** You can use this app on mobiles as it scales down perfectly!
